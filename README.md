Clothing as item script for QBCore &amp; illenium-appearance

Fisrt off, a HUGE shout out to @MrBluffz for the original ESX code https://github.com/MrBluffz

This is a simple script for doing clothes as items!
It especially works great for chains & other jewelry, turnout gear, or entire outfits even.


Don't forget to add the `item` to your `items.lua` for use, add inventory pics & run the SQL


COMMANDS:

`/changeback` will allow you to remove your last used clothing item, and return it to your inventory.
Last used clothing will set back on ped after relog/server restart. 

NOTE:

The item will be removed on use. You can stop it from being deleted by removing the following line in server.lua:
`Player.Functions.RemoveItem(Config[i].itemName, 1)` 

Pull request are welcome & encouraged as I IDK WTF I am doing. ðŸ˜•
